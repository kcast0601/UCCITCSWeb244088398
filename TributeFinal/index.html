            <p>
              She is a 19-year-old student in Baguio City, chasing her dreams with passion and grace as she takes up Bachelor of Science in Management Accounting.  
              Her determination shines through every challenge, and her heart remains gentle and kind no matter how busy life gets.  
              What makes her even more special is our shared hometown Talavera, Nueva Ecija the place where two paths were destined to meet.  
              She’s proof that beauty isn’t just seen, it’s felt in her laughter, in her care, and in the way she inspires everyone around her to dream a little bigger and love a little deeper.
